    "Title": "Ersilia Compound Embeddings",
    "Description": "Bioactivity-aware chemical embeddings for small molecules. Using transfer learning, we have created a fast network that produces embeddings of 1024 features condensing physicochemical as well as bioactivity information The training of the network has been done using the FS-Mol and ChEMBL datasets, and Grover, Mordred and ECFP descriptors",
